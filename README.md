## Project Description
This project is a proof-of-concept data warehouse customisation developed for MakCorp. It enhances the existing data platform with a suite of admin-managed and user-centric features, including real-time website editability for administrators, an email notification system that sends contact form submissions to administrators, intuitive dashboard filtering and visualisation, a modernised and accessible user interface with integrated social media, YouTube, and news content, and a secure Stripe payment gateway for users. Built using JavaScript, React, Chart.js, and Django, this demonstration showcases the potential for a more interactive and efficient data experience.
